# kozy-2gether

## Project's description / Aspirations

In the last decade, Korea has been earning a spot as one of the most ascending countries and many have been trying to learn its language. Learning a new language can be a hard experience because everything is new and you can get lost very easily. Besides that, you have to keep practicing and reviewing now and then to make sure that you are actually learning and not just jumping from one grammar point to another. This process can be hard to cope with anxiety and loneliness if you don't have much contact with other people on the same journey.

To make learning more fun, "Kozy: 2gether" aims to be an **online board game platform** focused on **Korean language learning**. It will be a safe space to level up your grammar, vocabulary, and sentence-making skills while playing with your friends. In addition to the goal of making the user have a good time, "Kozy: 2gether" also promises to make learning Korean cozier and less lonely.

This is a project created to help me improve my skills using git, TypeScript, JavaScript and React.

## Expected list of features

- [ ] **Multiplayer game experience:** To have a good real-time game experience, the user will be able to join a room using a code (unique for each room). 
- [ ] **Board DB:** When creating a room, the user will be able to choose from a set of boards each one with different grammar points and vocabulary. 
- [ ] **Keeping track of the score and user's position:** The website will be able to keep track of the score changes and the users' position in each room, updating the score and board in real-time if needed. 
- [ ] **Virtual dice:** To make the user experience more delightful, a dice will be at the center of each room and the user will use it to determine the number of tiles that should be skipped.
